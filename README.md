# PMSDNet
A new progressive multi-scale CNN for image denoising (PMSDNet) by Jibin Deng*, Chaohua Hu is submitted to Signal, Image and Video Processing (Major Revision), 2023.
 
# Prerequisites:
python == 3.6.2

tensorflow == 2.0.0

keras == 2.3.1

opencv-python == 4.5.5.62

scikit-image == 0.17.2

# Prepare training dataset
Taking the gray training dataset "Train400" for example, please run:

python data_generator.py

# Denoising Training
For train the PMSDNet, please run:

python mainimprovement.py

# Denoising Testing
The pretrained models have been uploaded to the folder "pretrained_models".

For test the PMSDNet, please run:

python mainimprovement.py --pretrain sigma (e.g., 15, 25, 35 and 50)/model_50.h5 --only_test True
